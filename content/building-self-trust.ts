Self-trust doesn’t disappear overnight — and it doesn’t return overnight either.

It often fades slowly through experiences of self-doubt, external pressure,
or difficult relationships. Over time, you may begin questioning your own
judgment, instincts, or emotional responses.

Rebuilding self-trust begins with noticing.

Noticing what you feel.
Noticing what you need.
Noticing when something feels aligned — or misaligned.

In therapy, we often focus on:

• Identifying internal narratives that create doubt  
• Strengthening emotional awareness  
• Practicing small decisions with intention  
• Honoring boundaries  

Self-trust grows in quiet moments of listening to yourself.
It grows when you allow space for reflection instead of self-criticism.

With time and support, your internal voice becomes clearer —
not louder, but steadier.
