Feeling overwhelmed can feel like standing in the middle of noise —
too many thoughts, too many demands, too little space to breathe.

You might notice:

• Emotional exhaustion  
• Irritability  
• Difficulty focusing  
• A desire to withdraw  

Overwhelm often happens when responsibilities outpace capacity.
When expectations are high.
When rest becomes secondary.

In therapy, we slow things down.

We explore what feels heavy.
We untangle what feels urgent versus what feels important.
We rebuild your relationship to rest.

Overwhelm is not weakness.
It’s a signal.

When we listen to it instead of pushing through it,
clarity begins to return.
