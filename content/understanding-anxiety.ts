Anxiety is not a flaw. It’s a response.

It’s your nervous system attempting to protect you — even when there’s no
immediate threat.

Sometimes anxiety shows up as racing thoughts.
Sometimes as physical tension.
Sometimes as avoidance or difficulty making decisions.

When anxiety becomes chronic, it can begin to limit your world.
You may avoid conversations, opportunities, or even rest because your
mind is constantly scanning for danger.

Therapy helps create space between you and the anxious response.

Together, we explore:

• Identifying triggers  
• Recognizing patterns of avoidance  
• Strengthening regulation skills  
• Developing grounding practices  

Anxiety may not disappear entirely — but it can become manageable.
And when it becomes manageable, your world becomes wider again.
