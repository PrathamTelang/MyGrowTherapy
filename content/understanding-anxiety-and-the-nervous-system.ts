Anxiety is not simply “overthinking.”

It is a full-body response — your nervous system preparing for threat, even when no immediate danger is present. Racing thoughts, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping, and a constant sense of urgency are often signs that your system is operating in survival mode.

For many adults, especially those who are high-achieving or responsible for a great deal, anxiety can become normalized. You may function well externally while feeling internally on edge.

In therapy, we work on both cognitive and physiological regulation. This includes understanding thought patterns, but also helping your body learn how to feel safer. Approaches such as CBT, mindfulness, and body-oriented techniques can reduce anxiety not just temporarily, but sustainably.

Anxiety can become more manageable when the nervous system experiences steadiness repeatedly over time.
