When you’ve lived in high stress for extended periods, your sense of internal steadiness can weaken. You may second-guess decisions, question your reactions, or feel disconnected from your own needs.

Chronic stress prioritizes survival and productivity over reflection. Over time, this can distance you from your internal cues.

Rebuilding self-trust involves slowing down enough to notice what you feel and need. Therapy provides structured space to explore patterns, reduce self-criticism, and strengthen emotional awareness.

Self-trust does not return instantly. It grows gradually through repeated experiences of safety, clarity, and aligned decision-making.

A steadier relationship with yourself becomes possible.
